# Get-Clean-EDGAR-data

# Intro to SEC-EDGAR
EDGAR is a database that all companies, foreign and domestic, are required to file registration statements, periodic reports, and other forms electronically through.

# Project Goal
This project is done in March 2020, when working as intern at Global AI. All data is directly from EDGAR website through API and it's free so anyone can access it. This project's goal is to create two csv files, one for filing data of each file types of each company, e.g., information from 10K file of Apple; the other for company data of each company.
